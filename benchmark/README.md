This folder has configuration files for making benchmark results with different methods and the same settings.

We train with 30\% of the whole CIFAR10 sample and test with 30\%. The rest of the dataset is considered population data, which will be used for population strikes or reference attacks.

To get all the attack results in this setting, please run
`bash run_benchmark.sh`

The results are saved in the benchmark folder in the experiments folder.
